* [product_option.csv](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/file-details-product-optioncsv): allows you to define product options, like insurance, warranty or gift wrapping, and its abstract products.
* [product_option_price.csv](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/file-details-product-option-pricecsv): allows you to define the net and gross prices for each product option.

Each data importer contains links to .csv files used to import the corresponding data, including specifications of mandatory and unique fields, dependencies, detailed explanations, recommendations, templates, and content examples.
